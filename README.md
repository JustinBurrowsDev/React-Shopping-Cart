## Setup
All of the image files needed for this assignment are inside of the public directory of the react application already. You'll need to fork this repository and clone it down to make sure you have them all. The images are named by the sku number in the data file for json-server. There are 2 images per sku {sku}_1.jpg and {sku}_2.jpg. One large for the product page and one smaller for the cart itself.

## Normal Mode
